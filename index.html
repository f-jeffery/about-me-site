        <h2>Ode to Sour Grapes</h2>
        <p>Inspired by an experience I had as a small child in an airport that traumatized me forever.</p>
        <div id="content">
            <p id="poem">With family I waited to fly
                <br>
                Nursing a hunger so bad I might die
                <br>
                When my aunt (full of japes)
                <br>
                Offered a handful of "grapes"
                <br>
                Now the sight of olives makes me cry

        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <div id="content">
            <p>I have a cat that I dedicate time to every day.  A little more than that when he's sick.  
                He's fond of taking walks outside on a leash (less to protect the birds and small animals than it is to save him from traffic).
                We meander around, and he chases just about any insect we happen upon. 
                <br>
                Except wasps.  He's finally learned to leave them alone.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a computer science major, I feel obligated to say that I like computers.  When they work, anyway.  About eight years ago I built my first,
                and I've been slowly changing the parts out to keep it from getting too old.  I won't claim to be an expert, but it turns out you don't need to be
                for people to ask you to put them together.  None of them have caught fire yet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other than that, I've been dabbling in game development.  I don't know if it will go anywhere.  I've found it to be rewarding when it goes right
                and dissapointing when it goes wrong.  The amount to do is daunting if I think too much about it, and like any good developer I keep adding more features so the project can go on forever.
